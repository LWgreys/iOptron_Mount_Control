iOptron_Mount_Control written by Lawrence Widacki.

It's just a simple manual control program for iOptron CEM GEM telescope mounts.
Coded in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio. 

I did find a few issues with the CEM firmware and have written iOptron support about the issues.

02-05-2024 Addin was the Periodic Error Correction tracking & record and the Reset PEC recording.

03-21-2024 Added 'Slew to Object' - requires internet to search SIMBA for data.

Future addins:

4. Make the program ASCOM compatible. - This feature may take awhile because I have to write an ASCOM driver for it.
